### Procedurally-generated research journal system.
#### Started Fall 2016, MSP

Bear with me here--

This is a procedurally generated research journal method that you can
easily use, once you get the hang of it. I use this method to keep my
own research journal; this is a skeleton version of the tools
required.

The goal was to make a searchable research journal in which I could
catalog ideas. I decided html provided the most flexibility and
cross-platform integration, and set Python as the backend of choice to
do the procedural generation.

Along the way I was forced to decide on some default formats, which
make the journals themselves see a little archaic. However, I think it
is fairly straightforward, and if it isn't, I'm happy to entertain
changing it!
